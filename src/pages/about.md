I'm a Senior Software Engineer in New York City. This site is where I share short write-ups, project notes, and practical findings from the things I build — concise, useful posts like code snippets, quick how-tos, and lessons learned. Expect no more than one post every sometimes.

You can email me at [keenan@keenant.com](mailto:keenan@keenant.com). I post code and projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/thekeenant) and connect with colleagues on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thekeenant/).

### A Note on AI

This site and its articles are written with the assistance of AI tools. I use them to draft, edit, and clarify my thoughts, as they help me communicate more effectively. My GitHub commit history is open and transparent, often showing the progression from AI-generated drafts to final refinements.
